# Exercise solutions for FCIM/PM at LMU Munich

This repository contains solutions for the exercises in the course 'Fortgeschrittene Computerintensive Methoden / Predictive Modeling'.
The official solutions are provided in R, hence I decided to also cover Python. I do not claim that I solved the exercises
correctly and that there are no mistakes. If you find any errors, feel free to contact me.

Most data handling relies on numpy and stuff related to tensorflow/keras is substituted with PyTorch.

### How to use?
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to repository: `cd fcim`
3. Create virtualenv: `python -m venv .venv`
4. Activate it: `source .venv/bin/activate`
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Execute the code for the desired exercise, e.g: `python exercise_1.py`
